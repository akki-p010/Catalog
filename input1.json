# Hashira Placements Assignment - Online

**Duration:** 45 mins

**Testing Environment/IDE:** Use any IDE or environment you are comfortable with

**Language:** Any language except **Python** is allowed

**Submission:** Push the code to github and provide the link in submission [form](https://forms.office.com/r/Kd5CE3SWcP) along with output.

You need to read the input from the test cases provided in JSON format.

### Sample Test Case:

```json
{
    "keys": {
        "n": 4,
        "k": 3
    },
    "1": {
        "base": "10",
        "value": "4"
    },
    "2": {
        "base": "2",
        "value": "111"
    },
    "3": {
        "base": "10",
        "value": "12"
    },
    "6": {
        "base": "4",
        "value": "213"
    }
}
```

**n:** The number of roots provided in the given JSON
**k:** The minimum number of roots required to solve for the coefficients of the polynomial
k = m + 1, where m is the degree of the polynomial

### Root Format Example:

```json
"2": {
    "base": "2",
    "value": "111"
}
```

**Hint:** Although you can't test your code against the test case in a testing environment, you can double-check it manually by solving the polynomial on paper and comparing the outputs.

Good luck!
